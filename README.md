Drupal 7 University of Cambridge teasers feature
================================================

This feature adds node view modes for horizontal, vertical and sidebar teasers. (The horizontal teaser actually replaces Drupal's default teaser.)

To have an image appear in the teaser use the `field_image` base image field provided by the [Images Styles feature](https://github.com/misd-service-development/drupal-feature-image-styles).

For each content type you will need to set the display settings as follows.

For both horizontal and vertical teasers:

For sidebar teasers:

If you are using a `field_link` provided by the [Link feature](https://github.com/misd-service-development/drupal-feature-link) you also need to make your link field available (it doesn't matter what format setting you use).
